# PROXYDALE  
### An unofficial small-player variant for Blood on the Clocktower (4–6 players)

**Blood on the Clocktower** is a social deduction game of secrets, logic, and deception, in which players take on unique roles with special abilities while a Storyteller guides the game and the narrative. It is published by The Pandemonium Institute.

Proxydale is a homebrew variant designed to make *Blood on the Clocktower* playable with only **4, 5, or 6 players**, while still preserving the structure and feeling of a full base game (not Teensyville).

The idea behind this project came very naturally from my own group. We love Clocktower, but we often find ourselves around the table with only 4 or 5 players plus a Storyteller. After countless Teensyville games, we started experimenting with ways to run meaningful, deduction-heavy sessions at very low player counts, without stripping the game down or fundamentally changing its identity.

That experimentation eventually led to **Proxydale**: a variant specifically designed to support longer arcs, layered information, and the broader strategic space of the standard game.

At its core, Proxydale introduces **empty chairs** that act as “proxy players”: full characters in the game, but without a physical player attached to them. Instead of reducing the game, Proxydale redistributes it.

# Rules in a nutshell

## Setup
- Increase the circle to **7, 8, or 9 total seats** by adding empty chairs.  
- Characters are assigned as in a normal game, with the only restriction that **at least one Good and one Evil character must belong to real players** (otherwise, re-deal or use Gardener to fix).  
- Empty chairs receive characters and alignments like normal players.  
- **Recommended Fabled:** Sentinel, Fibbin, Gardener.

## Empty chairs
Empty chairs represent full characters in play, but they are not players. They:
- can be killed, poisoned, drunk, etc.  
- can be nominated and executed  
- do not speak, vote, or nominate directly  

## Proxy system
Each empty chair’s ability is handled through a **proxy player of the same team**, chosen by the Storyteller when needed (alive or dead).

- **Night abilities** are resolved normally, with the proxy receiving the information or making choices.  
- **Day or mixed abilities** are assigned at the end of the night so the proxy can use them during the day.

The proxy player is told:
- which character activated  
- what information they learned and/or what action they must take  

The proxy is **never told which chair** the character belongs to.

- Good proxies only know the character exists somewhere among the living chairs.  
- Evil proxies can often deduce or know the location from the initial evil wake-up.

## Voting and majority
- Empty chairs do not vote and do not count toward majority.  
- Only living real players are used to calculate the votes needed for execution.

## Nominations involving chairs
- Chairs cannot nominate directly.  
- A dead player may ask a living chair to nominate on their behalf (once per day, clearly stated, and not targeting itself).  

After such a request, before voting begins, any Evil player (alive or dead) may publicly **veto** the nomination.  
The veto only works if **both the chair and the vetoing player are Evil**. If valid, the nomination is cancelled, with the obvious drawback that both are publicly revealed as Evil.

## Clarifications
- All effects (poison, drunkenness, madness, etc.) apply to chair characters normally.  
- If a chair’s character is poisoned or drunk, the proxy receives faulty information.  
- If a chair’s character is healthy, its information is correct even if the proxy is poisoned or drunk (unless another effect interferes).

# Design goal

Proxydale preserves the **information density of larger games** while introducing uncertainty about **where information belongs**, creating a more opaque, strategic, and deduction-focused experience for very small groups.

For the Good team, the main benefit lies in **informational continuity**: even with a small number of real players, the information flow typical of a full game is largely preserved thanks to the chairs. This allows for deeper deductions, cross-referencing of data, and the construction of coherent narratives over the medium term, rewarding coordination, shared memory, and probabilistic reasoning rather than individual certainty.

For the Evil team, Proxydale offers new opportunities for **concealment and manipulation**. The ability to know and coordinate with one’s ally enables more sophisticated strategies than in Teensyville, while the Good team’s inability to precisely locate characters opens broader spaces for ambiguity, bluffing, and misdirection than in the base game.

Overall, Proxydale is a variant designed for **experienced groups** who can appreciate a more cerebral and less declarative game, and which benefits decisively from an attentive, proactive Storyteller willing to intervene with the tools at their disposal (such as the Fibbin) to maintain pacing, clarity, and balance.

In this context, chairs are not merely a technical solution to a numerical problem, but become a **true design tool**, capable of transforming the game into an exercise in pure deduction and strategic tension.

# Recommended scripts

The following scripts are designed to highlight the unique mechanics of Proxydale, offering different play experiences in terms of complexity, cognitive load, and strategic depth:

- **Welcome to Proxydale**  
  Closest to a standard experience, without overburdening the Storyteller.

- **Revenge of the Seat**  
  Introduces more complex strategies using Proxydale-specific mechanics.

- **Final Delegation**  
  A true brain-teaser built around experimental synergies.
